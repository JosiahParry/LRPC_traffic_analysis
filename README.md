# LRPC_traffic_analysis

This repository contains all documentation, R files, and non-geospatial data used for a regional traffic analysis of the Lakes Region of New Hampshire for the [**Lakes Region Planning Commission**](lakesrpc.org).

There are a series of R markdown files that contain the steps in the analysis that I have embarked on. The goal of this project is to improve regional planning in the Lakes Region.
